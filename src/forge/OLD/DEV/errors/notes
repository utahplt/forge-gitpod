this file has some files in various syntaxes to test line locations in errors:
- error-test-ast.rkt: #lang racket: just imports and uses ast.rkt directly
- error-test-paren.rkt: #lang forge: parenthetical syntax
- error-test-forge.rkt: #lang forge: full syntax

I'll try to get them working in that order.

I also have a file kodkod-cli/server/error-tests.rkt with the same error.
It makes it to kodkod which crashes.
