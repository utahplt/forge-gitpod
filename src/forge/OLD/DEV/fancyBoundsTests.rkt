--- WORKING ---
run { some r } for myInst, 3 <= #A <= 4  -- s linearity contraint gone
--run { some B and some C }  -- #B = 0 constraint gone, C still one

--- ERRORS ---
--run {} for exactly #B = 3, #B = 4 -- conflicting int-bounds: no [3, 3] & [4, 4]
--run {} for exactly B=B0+B1+B2, #B = 4 -- conflicting int-bounds: no [3, 3] & [4, 4]
--run { some r } for exactly myInst, 3 <= #A <= 4 -- bounds declared exactly but r not exact
