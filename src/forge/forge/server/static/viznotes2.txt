Visualization goals:

1. Expanding instances from visualizer.
2. Removing relations
3. Optional zooming
4. Removing relations
5. Hiding / showing
6. Relations as attributes
7. State projection
8. Saved theming
9. Clustered layouts
10. Dag layouts
11. Manual theming JS input

Biggest priorities:
Manual theming			(CAN DO VIA CONSOLE FOR NOW)
Trying dag layouts		(NEXT)
Clustered layouts
Optional zooming button (DONE)
Expanding instances. 	(NOT PRIORITY)
ASK SIRTHIAS ABOUT THE BUG

Notes from Shriram: working on javascript evaluator for theming is good idea, esp. with clustered layouts.
Also, just do the zooming, it'll take two seconds.

Also, we should do a careful code audit of our model evaluator to make sure it does not assume anything extra
about the model.

That's the golden path. Worry about refactoring later. When you have time to relax and consider, that's when you
refactor.

Alright, klay is usable. But it's still not a good default layout.

do rows, one per sig, and then arrange the rows to minimize edge crossings.
How to do that? I need to experiment with compound nodes.
