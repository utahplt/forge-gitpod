-- Example Part 1 Comment
-- It's not possible to modify KittyBacon.connectionsOf so that it returns no counterexamples for any # of cats 
-- without using * or ^, since as more cats enter the equation, being friends of friends, etc, 
-- won't be enough to necessarily connect all cats to Kitty Bacon, unless the scope of 
-- Kitty Bacon.connectionsOf is adjusted according to the increase in number of cats. 
-- Even if it worked for a large number of cats, it wouldn't work for ANY number of cats.

// KittyBaconIsAFancyFeling was failing because FFF.membersOfFoundation
// only included KittyBacon's connectionsOf. However, because KittyBacon
// is not a part of his connections, KittyBacon was not being included
// in the foundation. My fix was to define FFF.membersOfFoundation
// as the union of KittyBacon.connectionsOf and KittyBacon.
// An alternative fix could be to define FFF.membersOfFoundation as
// the union between KittyBacon.connectionsOf and KittyBacon.connectionsOf.friends
