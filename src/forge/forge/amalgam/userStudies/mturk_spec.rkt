-- Properties that hold: 
-- (1) weHang users (excluding the NetworkOwner) can follow nobody
-- (2) The NetworkOwner needs to follow all weHang users  
-- (3) weHang users can't follow themselves
-- (4) weHang users (excluding the NetworkOwner) are verified if they have more than 2 followers
--     and have a profile pic
-- (5) The NetworkOwner is always verified
-- (6) The NetworkOwner needs to have a profile picture 

-- Properties that don't hold:
-- (1) follows is a symmetric relation
-- (2) not all users can be verified 
-- (4) weHang users can have no followers
